This Python 2.7 script is used to convert a 24 bit-per-pixel bitmap image to a .c and .h file for linking with the BikeLight firmware during compilation. This will be loaded into the flash memory of the Atmel chip for display on the BikeLight board.

The bitmap file must be exactly 10 pixels tall, but the width can be anywhere from 1 to maybe 200 pixels.

Requirements:
    Python 2.7 must be installed.
    Bitmap image must be 24 bpp.
    Bitmap image must be 10 pixels tall.
    
Usage:
    py BmpConverter.py image_name.bmp

Output:
    image.c: a C source code file containing the image data.
    image.h: a C header file containing information about the image.
    
    These files are included in the Arduino source project that is loaded onto the BikeLight (Arduino-compatible) board.
